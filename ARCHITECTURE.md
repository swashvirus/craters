## ARCHATECTURE
Craters mainly consists of craters render-loop, canvas-2d-renderer as well as assets-manger. most modules are dependant on these three core modules.
### DESIGN
A tile is a most basic graphic element a renderer can draw. All other types of elements such as sprites and font maps are derived from it.
### PHILOSOPHY
Craters is built to be modular and relatively simple to understand.
